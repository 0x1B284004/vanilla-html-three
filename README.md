# vanilla-html-three
	This project is a challenge I gave myself a few days ago to improve my web development skills
	that i thought were kinda rusty ! After a few days of crying reading Three.js documentation's
	I decided to make this project open-source : Feel free to paste whatever you want, as a great
	developper said : 
 		"Paste or get pasted"

# The idea
	Project is to make a simple show-off website in vanilla html 5, I wanted to do something cool
	and i thought that including Three.js canvas would be cool so i decided to add some 3D render
